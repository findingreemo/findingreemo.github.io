            <h1>Reem Ahmed of Bakersfield, CA</h1>
            <p>Reem Ahmed is a serial internet stalker and harasser currently living in Bakersfield, CA. In January of 2018, I had an encounter with Reem Ahmed that resulted in several members of my family enduring constant harassing phone calls and direct messages on social media websites. Despite numerous requests for these actions to cease, and even at the threat of police involvement, Reem Ahmed continues to participate in and encourage others to harass my family to this date of February 12th, 2018. I've been in direct contact with several others who have received harassing phone calls and messages from Reem Ahmed, some going back as far as three years from the current date of February 12th, 2018.</p>
            <p>Reem Ahmed seems to dedicate a large amount of time and resources into harassing people that she has encountered online. All of this behavior seems to be premeditated and meticulous. Reem Ahmed creates multiple non-identifying aliases and accounts on online messaging services, such as Kik and Instagram. Reem Ahmed uses these aliases and accounts as a way to conceal her identity while threatening and harassing people. Reem Ahmed often accesses the Internet using a smartphone with no SIM card. Reem Ahmed is also often behind a virtual private network (VPN). Due to this, Reem Ahmed has a very small online footprint. However, during my efforts in attempting to convince her to stop harassing my family, I've collected and documented several important pieces of information that have helped me identify Reem Ahmed.</p>
            <p>This website exists as a place that I can share public information about Reem Ahmed so that anyone else who is victimized by her gratuitous and obsessive behavior can easily identify who she is and take their own personal actions to protect themselves and their family against such behavior.</p>
            <p>All information on this website is is available publicly on the Internet and is protected by the California Public Records Act (<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=7.&chapter=3.5.&lawCode=GOV&title=1.&article=1." target="_blank">California Government Code §§ 6250 through 6276.48</a>). California was the first state to pass an anti-stalking law in 1990, and this law still exists today as <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=646.9&lawCode=PEN" target="_blank">California Penal Code 646.9</a>. California continues to be at the forefront of legislation against online harassment, and all applicable laws and references are displayed in the footer of this page.</p>
